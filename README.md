#EcoSync

Trusted projects can be found where reputation is important. Those who care about reputation, care who they are involved with. Let's use this.

##How it works

1. You connect the wallet
2. You enter your project name, logo, token symbol, description
3. Once you are in, you can add other reigstered projects into your ecosystem, using their wallet address.
4. Assuming, that other projects can also add your project into their ecosystem, you can query complex data from the chain and analyze for your benefit, navigate to 'Global' for that.

##How to run

1. `git clone https://github.com/gylman/eco-sync.git`
2. `cd eco-sync`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run dev`
